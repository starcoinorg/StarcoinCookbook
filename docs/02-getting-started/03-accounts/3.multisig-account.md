# Multisig accounts and multisig transactions

[Account concept](../../concepts/account)

This section describes the use of multisig accounts, including how to create multisig accounts on-chain via the CLI, and how to initiate multisig transactions. For the principle and implementation of multi-signature accounts, please refer to the multi-signature account section of the [account concept](../../concepts/account).

## Pre-preparation

Multi-signature transactions involve multiple participants. Here we use three participants, alice, bob and tom, to illustrate the process of multi-signature transactions.

1. First, you need to start three Starcoin `dev` nodes locally, corresponding to alice, bob and tom respectively, and connect to the console at the same time.
The `--discover-local` option allows nodes to discover other nodes in the local area network, and then connect into a network.

```bash
% starcoin -n dev -d alice --discover-local true console
% starcoin -n dev -d bob --discover-local true console
% starcoin -n dev -d tom --discover-local true console
```

We use the default accounts provided by the three nodes as the personal accounts of alice, bob and tom respectively.

Personal account addresses of alice, bob and tom:

```text
alice: 0x31515d36fa0b9e01bbdb1638d7c79e51
bob: 0x991c2f856a1e32985d9793b449c0f9d3
tom: 0x17183867a6142e821ee8a2dc6bb4d69d
```

2. Use the following commands to generate a new public-private key pair for each:

```bash
starcoin% account generate-keypair

# As follow:
{
  "ok": [
    {
      "address": "0xb6b67729f9ed83f3cf542952fbded752",
      "auth_key": "0x459381118ed14d42097b977aae5fe1d4b6b67729f9ed83f3cf542952fbded752",
      "private_key": "0xa530797cfb5fad79fe5ebf6add24dafbc141021a7d9c164840db0e29d944593d",
      "public_key": "0xf423c3d02ac400037a40e8dbbf8b3c3e4545548ff71332737bbfe1abbef97cb5",
      "receipt_identifier": "stc1pk6m8w20eakpl8n6599f0hhkh2gg3czy9"
    }
  ]
}
```

The generated key pair has 5 fields of information:

```text
address -> Generate address (in this demo, useless)
auth_key -> authentication key
private_key -> private key
public_key -> public key
receipt_identifier -> receipt identifier
```

**Note:** Do not confuse `the personal account address` with `the address generated by generate-keypair`!

Here, it is assumed that the three of them generate pair key information (for example only, do not use it in the official network) are:

- alice:
  - pubkey: 0xf423c3d02ac400037a40e8dbbf8b3c3e4545548ff71332737bbfe1abbef97cb5
  - prikey: 0xa530797cfb5fad79fe5ebf6add24dafbc141021a7d9c164840db0e29d944593d

- bob:
  - pubkey: 0x3639b4d6bc2d6588a6517f82ae1ff7fa1e64eb994a4d8ee6d6f948e1997b97d0
  - prikey: 0x163e272560e53b75c087bc424fc7ff8cdbc0608ce4695f9bf69c8bd430a2bfeb

- tom:
  - pubkey: 0x7315e22ea8bd4aaa8bdfe65b4a3c9334d726e12c21881cbbe9a79f57538c6301
  - prikey: 0xe38bfd1510a24c54d966dcbe13a4d06a798606f4b557823845156857b4dfb0b1

3. Each console gets 10,000 STC for the default account through the `dev get-coin -v 10000STC` command.

After completing the above preparations, let's start our multi-signature transaction process. The main steps are as follows:

1. First we create a multi-signature account locally.
2. Then ask alice to transfer an STC to this multi-signature account.
3. Finally, initiate a multi-signature transaction in the name of this multi-signature account: transfer money from the multi-signature account to bob.

## Generate multisig account

It is assumed here that the reader understands the basic concepts of multi-signature accounts.

In this section, we will create a multi-signature account maintained by **three** participants, and transactions only require the signatures of two of them (`threshold=2`). We use the public-private key pair generated above and `threshold=2` to generate a multi-signature account.

First, a multi-signature account jointly maintained by three people is generated in the nodes of alice, bob and tom.

Execute in alice's console:

```bash
# --pubkey specifies the generated public key of bob and tom, --prikey specifies the generated private key of alice
starcoin% account import-multisig --pubkey 0x3639b4d6bc2d6588a6517f82ae1ff7fa1e64eb994a4d8ee6d6f948e1997b97d0 --pubkey 0x7315e22ea8bd4aaa8bdfe65b4a3c9334d726e12c21881cbbe9a79f57538c6301 --prikey 0xa530797cfb5fad79fe5ebf6add24dafbc141021a7d9c164840db0e29d944593d -t 2
```

Execute in bob's console:

```bash
# --pubkey specifies the generated public key of alice and tom, --prikey specifies the generated private key of bob
starcoin% account import-multisig --pubkey 0xf423c3d02ac400037a40e8dbbf8b3c3e4545548ff71332737bbfe1abbef97cb5 --pubkey 0x7315e22ea8bd4aaa8bdfe65b4a3c9334d726e12c21881cbbe9a79f57538c6301 --prikey 0x163e272560e53b75c087bc424fc7ff8cdbc0608ce4695f9bf69c8bd430a2bfeb -t 2
```

Execute in tom's console:

```bash
# --pubkey specifies the generated public key of alice and bob, --prikey specifies the generated private key of tom
starcoin% account import-multisig --pubkey 0xf423c3d02ac400037a40e8dbbf8b3c3e4545548ff71332737bbfe1abbef97cb5 --pubkey 0x3639b4d6bc2d6588a6517f82ae1ff7fa1e64eb994a4d8ee6d6f948e1997b97d0 --prikey 0xe38bfd1510a24c54d966dcbe13a4d06a798606f4b557823845156857b4dfb0b1 -t 2
```

The `--pubkey` option specifies that `generate-keypair` generates a public key instead of the personal account's public key, the `--prikey` option specifies the private key generated by `generate-keypair` instead of the personal account's private key, and the `-t` option specifies the number of signatures required, ie `threshold`.

After executing the above commands on the three consoles, you will find that the three commands all generate the same multi-signature account information:

```bash
{
  "ok": {
    "address": "0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a",
    "is_default": false,
    "is_readonly": false,
    "public_key": "0x3639b4d6bc2d6588a6517f82ae1ff7fa1e64eb994a4d8ee6d6f948e1997b97d07315e22ea8bd4aaa8bdfe65b4a3c9334d726e12c21881cbbe9a79f57538c6301f423c3d02ac400037a40e8dbbf8b3c3e4545548ff71332737bbfe1abbef97cb502",
    "receipt_identifier": "stc1p3t7hxy2xl0pqd4tzvkk7md94pgvvpcut"
  }
}
```

**Understand the public and private keys of multi-signature accounts:**

You can see that the public key of this multi-signature account is very long.
In fact, the private key of a multi-signature account is spliced from multiple single-signature private keys, each of which holds `1/n`, and the public key of a multi-signature account is spliced from the public keys generated by multiple single-signature private keys.
The multisig public key is public, and everyone holds the same multisig public key.

View multi-signature accounts:

```bash
starcoin% account show 0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a
{
  "ok": {
    "account": {
      "address": "0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a",
      "is_default": false,
      "is_readonly": false,
      "public_key": "0x3639b4d6bc2d6588a6517f82ae1ff7fa1e64eb994a4d8ee6d6f948e1997b97d07315e22ea8bd4aaa8bdfe65b4a3c9334d726e12c21881cbbe9a79f57538c6301f423c3d02ac400037a40e8dbbf8b3c3e4545548ff71332737bbfe1abbef97cb502",
      "receipt_identifier": "stc1p3t7hxy2xl0pqd4tzvkk7md94pgvvpcut"
    },
    "auth_key": "0xf112c676ef1a7bfbd29699f14a6260c88afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a",
    "balances": {},
    "sequence_number": null
  }
}
```

## Transfer money to a multisig account

In this section, we transfer 1000 STC from tom's account to this multi-signature account.

Executed in tom's Starcoin console:

```bash
starcoin% account transfer -r 0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a -v 1000000000000 -b
```

Then check the information of the multi-signature account:

```bash
starcoin% account show 0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a
{
  "ok": {
    "account": {
      "address": "0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a",
      "is_default": false,
      "is_readonly": false,
      "public_key": "0x3639b4d6bc2d6588a6517f82ae1ff7fa1e64eb994a4d8ee6d6f948e1997b97d07315e22ea8bd4aaa8bdfe65b4a3c9334d726e12c21881cbbe9a79f57538c6301f423c3d02ac400037a40e8dbbf8b3c3e4545548ff71332737bbfe1abbef97cb502",
      "receipt_identifier": "stc1p3t7hxy2xl0pqd4tzvkk7md94pgvvpcut"
    },
    "auth_key": "0xf112c676ef1a7bfbd29699f14a6260c88afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a",
    "balances": {
      "0x00000000000000000000000000000001::STC::STC": 1000000000000
    },
    "sequence_number": 0
  }
}
```

Pay attention to the `balances` field: the multi-signature account already has 1000 STC at this point.

## Initiate a multisig transaction

Now the multi-signature account has 1000 STC.

Let's initiate a multi-signature transaction: transfer 1 STC from the multi-signature account to bob.

Execute in tom's Starcoin console:

```bash
starcoin% account sign-multisig-txn -s 0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a --function 0x1::TransferScripts::peer_to_peer_v2 -t 0x1::STC::STC --arg 0x991c2f856a1e32985d9793b449c0f9d3 --arg 1000000000u128
```

where `peer_to_peer_v2` script parameters:

- `0x991c2f856a1e32985d9793b449c0f9d3` is bob's personal account address.
- `1000000000u128` is the number of tokens to send.

After a while, you should see the last few lines of output:

```bash
mutlisig txn(address: 0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a, threshold: 2): 1 signatures collected
still require 1 signatures
{
  "ok": "/94713c208ff452d4d02c5446eb18f5ab538b72976e08a84cada4b08be68583ab.multisig-txn"
}
```

This command will generate the original transaction and sign it with tom's **multi-signature account private key**.
The generated transaction will be saved as a file in the current directory, and the file name is the hash of the transaction.

Note: The file path will vary slightly according to different operating systems and usage methods.

Command line prompt: One signature has been collected for this multi-signature transaction, and another signature is required.
At this point, the generated transaction file needs to be distributed to other participants of the multi-signature account for signature.

## Signatures of other participants

After alice gets the above transaction file, she signs it in her Starcoin console:

```bash
starcoin% account sign-multisig-txn /94713c208ff452d4d02c5446eb18f5ab538b72976e08a84cada4b08be68583ab.multisig-txn
```

After a while, you should see the last few lines of output:

```bash
mutlisig txn(address: 0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a, threshold: 2): 2 signatures collected
enough signatures collected for the multisig txn, txn can be submitted now
{
  "ok": "/root/f93382dc60d1f518e313202cc6f0b86116ba81e25b554b174537bfae18987837.multisig-txn"
}
```

This command will generate another multi-signature transaction signature file, which contains the signatures of **tom's multi-signature private key** and **alice's multi-signature private key**.
The returned information prompts the user that the multi-signature transaction has collected enough signatures and can be submitted to the chain for execution.

## Submit a multi-signature transaction

After the multi-signature transaction is fully generated, anyone can submit it to the chain.
Here we submit the multisig transaction from bob's Starcoin console.

```bash
starcoin% account submit-multisig-txn f93382dc60d1f518e313202cc6f0b86116ba81e25b554b174537bfae18987837.multisig-txn
```

```bash
txn 0xf93382dc60d1f518e313202cc6f0b86116ba81e25b554b174537bfae18987837 submitted.
{
  "ok": {
    "events": null,
    "txn_hash": "0xf93382dc60d1f518e313202cc6f0b86116ba81e25b554b174537bfae18987837",
    "txn_info": null
  }
}
```

After waiting for the execution, check the information of the multi-signature account, and you will find that the balance of the multi-signature account has been reduced (gas fee and 1 STC transferred out), and the `sequence_number` of the account has also become 1, indicating that the transaction has been successfully executed.

```bash
starcoin% account show 0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a
{
  "ok": {
    "account": {
      "address": "0x8afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a",
      "is_default": false,
      "is_readonly": false,
      "public_key": "0x3639b4d6bc2d6588a6517f82ae1ff7fa1e64eb994a4d8ee6d6f948e1997b97d07315e22ea8bd4aaa8bdfe65b4a3c9334d726e12c21881cbbe9a79f57538c6301f423c3d02ac400037a40e8dbbf8b3c3e4545548ff71332737bbfe1abbef97cb502",
      "receipt_identifier": "stc1p3t7hxy2xl0pqd4tzvkk7md94pgvvpcut"
    },
    "auth_key": "0xf112c676ef1a7bfbd29699f14a6260c88afd731146fbc206d56265adedb4b50a",
    "balances": {
      "0x00000000000000000000000000000001::STC::STC": 998999894453
    },
    "sequence_number": 1
  }
}
```

So far, you have completed the creation of a multi-signature account and the generation and on-chain execution of multi-signature transactions.
